					<h3>John Wick</h3>
					<p>The story focuses on John Wick (Reeves) who seeks revenge on the son of Russian gangster for stealing his vintage car and killing his puppy, which serves as a memento of his recently deceased wife, Helen. Stahelski and David Leitch directed the film together, though only Stahelski was credited.
						Kolstad wrote the screenplay in 2012 and developed it for Thunder Road Pictures. The film was produced by Basil Iwanyk of Thunder Road Pictures, Leitch, Eva Longoria, and Michael Witherill. It marks Stahelski and Leitch's directorial debut as a team after multiple separate credits as second-unit directors and stunt coordinators. They previously worked with Reeves as stunt doubles on The Matrix trilogy.
						The film was met with positive reviews, with critics calling it one of Reeves' best performances and one of the best action films of 2014. It grossed $88 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million.</p>

					<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
					<p>Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. He and Annabel Jones serve as the programme's showrunners. It examines modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. Episodes are standalone, usually set in an alternative present or the near future, often with a dark and satirical tone, although some are more experimental and lighter.
						Black Mirror was inspired by older anthology series, such as The Twilight Zone, which were able to deal with controversial, contemporary topics without fear of censorship. Brooker developed Black Mirror to highlight topics related to humanity's relationship with technology, creating stories that feature "the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy."[1]
						The series premiered for two series on the British television channel Channel 4 in December 2011 and February 2013. After its addition to the catalogue in December 2014, Netflix purchased the programme in September 2015. It commissioned a series of 12 episodes later divided into the third and fourth series, each comprising six episodes; the former was released on 21 October 2016 and the latter on 29 December 2017. A standalone interactive film titled Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was released on 28 December 2018. A fifth series, comprising three episodes, was released on 5 June 2019</p>
